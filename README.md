# Active Power Calculation from Windmill Data

This project focuses on calculating the active power generated by windmills using a dataset that includes various operational parameters. The goal is to analyze the data, develop models to accurately calculate active power, and provide insights into the performance of windmills.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:
- **Data Exploration**: Understand the structure and distribution of the data, and identify key features that influence active power generation.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies in the dataset.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that could improve the accuracy of the active power calculations.
- **Model Building**: Develop and train machine learning models to calculate active power.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the models using appropriate metrics and refine them for better accuracy.
- **Visualization**: Create visualizations to showcase the insights and results of the analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes various parameters collected from windmills, such as:
- Wind speed
- Rotor speed
- Blade angle
- Generator temperature
- Ambient temperature
